    <section class="services">
        <h2>Types of Business Entities in Ghana</h2>
        <div class="service-cards">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>1. Sole Proprietorship</h3>
                <p>A Sole Proprietorship is the simplest form of business ownership, operated and owned by one individual. It is easy to set up, cost-effective, and ideal for small business owners or freelancers. This type of business has no legal separation between the owner and the business — all profits and liabilities belong to the individual.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Freelancers, small shops, individual service providers</li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Low startup costs, full control, simple tax filing</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Personal liability for business debts</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>2. Partnership</h3>
                <p>A Partnership is a business owned by two or more individuals who share responsibilities, profits, and liabilities. Partnerships are often formed when multiple people come together to run a business with a shared vision.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Legal firms, medical practices, family-run businesses</li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Shared resources and responsibilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Shared liability; legal agreement is recommended</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>3. Company (Limited Liability)</h3>
                <p>A Company is a legally distinct entity from its owners. It can own property, sue, and be sued in its own name. Owners (shareholders) are not personally liable for the company’s debts beyond their investment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Startups, large businesses, formal organizations</li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Limited liability, credibility, access to investment</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Strict regulatory compliance, annual filings</li>
                </ul>
